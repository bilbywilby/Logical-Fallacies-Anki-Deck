"Label and remedy: 'We haven't found any harm from supplement A, so it's safe.'","Fallacy: Appeal to Ignorance / Argument from Silence. Remedy: require controlled safety studies, adverse event surveillance, dose‑response data, and long‑term follow‑up.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Detect the fallacy: 'If policy B fails once, it proves it's always bad.'","Fallacy: Hasty Generalization / Overgeneralization. Remedy: examine context of failure, sample size, implementation fidelity, and replicate before generalizing.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Which fallacy: 'Because two things co-occur, one must cause the other.' Provide an example of confounding.","Fallacy: False Cause / Correlation ≠ causation. Example confounder: ice cream sales and drowning both rise in summer—temperature is the confounder.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Explain why 'No true fan would criticize this band' is fallacious and how to respond.","Fallacy: No True Scotsman (ad hoc exclusion). Response: challenge the redefinition, present counterexamples, and ask for substantive criteria that define 'true fan.'",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Transform this vague promotional claim into testable evaluation criteria: 'Our product makes teams more productive.'","Testable criteria: measure baseline and post‑implementation team output (tasks completed, cycle time), quality metrics, and employee satisfaction; use control groups and pre/post analysis.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Spot the Red Herring and give a succinct redirect: 'Why discuss healthcare costs? Look at how much politicians lie.'","Red Herring: diverts to politician behavior. Redirect: note that politician honesty is separate and then refocus: 'Let's examine healthcare cost drivers and policy options.'",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Identify the fallacy in this appeal: 'This new diet is trending—so it must be healthiest.'","Fallacy: Bandwagon / Appeal to Popularity or Appeal to Novelty. Counter: require clinical trials, objective health outcomes, and long‑term safety data.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Explain the flaw: 'My company's product succeeded because I used it; therefore it's the best solution.'","Fallacy: Anecdotal Evidence / Survivor bias. Flaw: single user success doesn't control for selection bias. Require comparative studies, A/B tests, and representative outcomes.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Is this a false analogy? 'Managing a team is like herding cats.' Discuss usefulness and limits.","Metaphor useful for conveying difficulty (loose coordination), but weak as precise analogy because people have agency and reasons unlike animals—useful rhetorically but poor as evidence for management policy.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Identify and correct: 'We must act now; it's urgent—no time for evidence.'","Fallacy: Appeal to Emotion / Urgency fallacy. Correct: balance urgency with rapid evidence‑gathering: implement short pilots, monitor outcomes, and use adaptive policies.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Determine fallacy & rewrite as fair scientific claim: 'Scientists can't explain X, therefore supernatural cause.'","Fallacy: Argument from Ignorance / God of the gaps. Rewrite: 'Current scientific models don't fully explain X; propose testable hypotheses and research programs to investigate natural mechanisms.'",logical-fallacies application,Basic
"Create a 3‑step checklist to convert a persuasive claim into an evidence question.","Checklist: (1) Define precise outcome measures; (2) Identify comparison condition(s) and confounders; (3) Specify study design and data needed to test the claim.",logical-fallacies application,Basic
