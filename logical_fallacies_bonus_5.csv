"Which fallacy: 'If you disagree, you're on the wrong side of history.' Suggest a rational reply.", "Fallacy: Bulverism / Appeal to consequences/authority of history.

"Explain 'Appeal to Moderation' and provide an example where it fails.", "Appeal to Moderation (argument to the middle): assuming the middle ground is correct. Fails when one side is factually correct (e.g., climate science consensus vs denial); the middle may be incorrect.",logical-fallacies bonus,Basic
"Appeal to Moderation — The {{c1::compromise}} is not inherently correct; verify with evidence.",logical-fallacies bonus,Cloze
"Give a quick rebuttal to: 'We must accept X because it's tradition.'", "Rebuttal: tradition alone isn't evidence—present data or reasons why X remains beneficial today; if none, consider reform.",logical-fallacies bonus,Basic
